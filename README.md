# aminogfx-gl
AminoGFX implementation for OpenGL / GLES2

If you are building this by hand you'll need to have pkg-config installed, and glfw3 and freetype.

On MacOSX w/ Brew:

```
brew install pkg-config
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install glfw3
brew install freetype
npm install
node demos/circle.js
```
